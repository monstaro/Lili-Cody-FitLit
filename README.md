# FitLit - A Modern Approach to Fitness Tracking
### By Lili Manrique and Cody Smith


## Summary
Fitlit is an application used to track and chart health-related data from its users. Included in this file is a dataset of 50 users, and datasets of various health categories (hydration, sleep, steps, etc.) that are associated with the user dataset by a unique ID number. That information is then used to display various statistics on the web page, such as a data rundown for today, all-time records, averages, and more. Users are also able to see where they rank against other users.  


## Setup and Download
To pull this project into your local machine, run `git clone https://github.com/monstaro/Lili-Cody-FitLit.git` in your terminal. After the repo is cloned down, run `npm install` in your root directory. 

## Instructions
To use this app, either run `open index.html` from the repo's root directory in your terminal, or navigate to https://monstaro.github.io/Lili-Cody-FitLit/index.html to use the version deployed on the web. 
From their, if you are a user, you may enter your e-mail address to see your information. Some sample e-mail addresses you can use to test this feature are `Dylan_Langworth65@hotmail.com` and `Eric_Aufderhar@yahoo.com`. You may also select the 'random profile' button and a random user will load. These are not real users, so there is no sensitive data at risk here. 

There are some interactive charts on the page, which you can mouseover to see the numerical data for each day of the week.
For now, 'today' on the site simply represents the most recent date in the dataset. Likewise, any weekly information is based off the last 7 days of the dataset.
